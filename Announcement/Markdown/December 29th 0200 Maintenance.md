# December 29th 0200 Maintenance

**Dear commanders:**
There will be a maintenance on **December 28th 0200**, estimated to be around 2 hours. Compensation will be **150BC** and **10000 Nuts**.

## System Optimization

1. Added a hint that auto-play is on in some stories (Idk why is only some)
2. Optimized the icon position for **Christmas Tree menu**
3. Fixed incorrect description for the collectible, **Moth Queen Sample** (The one you get from the moth boss, Olivia said it looks like an insect, so lets go with it)
4. Fixed incorrect story text description within **Between Christmas Night and Starry Night**
5. Fixed abnormal icon display within the 5th stage (the one where you play as plane) of Phoenix's character story
6. Fixed commanders getting stuck when they open **mentor missions** without having any pupils
7. Fixed unable to complete the stage normally if you beat **Moth Queen** within the boss mode, in overspeed (the last one), with Alpha and take no damage
