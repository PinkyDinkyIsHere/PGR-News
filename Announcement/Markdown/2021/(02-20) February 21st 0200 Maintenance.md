## The Punishing Force Event Problem

Additionally, commanders who have participated in this season, their rewards will be sent out based on their **best performance in these past 3 seasons (January 25th 0500 - February 15th 0459)**. For commanders who participated in this event before or currently, but have never tiered into the reward zone, will be rewarded based on **【51-100】times tier**.
