**Dear commanders:** (Editor Note: Mom is how PGR refers to their fans)

We announced the winner for the **PGR's Mom Of The Year** event on Weibo on **January 1st 1600 GMT +8**. However, it caused a lot of controversy. Based on this situation, we have investigated and discussed with the winner internally, as well as contacting Weibo soon after the situation, this is our statement on the results of this event:

1. The **PGR's Mom Of The Year** event organized this time around, due our operation team thoughtlessness on the drawing mechanic, we here apologize to every single commander. After the results was announced automatically on Weibo, we immediately contacted Weibo for a discussion and appeal, but sadly, after days of waiting and struggle, we still didn't get a satisfying result from them.
2. We have decided to do another event draw on **PGR's Mom Of The Year** on Weibo. This chance will only be reserved to commanders who supported and been through with PGR. The rules of drawing this time around will also be stricter than before. We will also be adding an additional, special, **commemorative** reward. This reward will also be given to the winner on Bilibili. Regarding the suggestion given by commanders, we will definitely consider carefully and update commanders immediately with the optimized plan.
3. The primarily goal of the **PGR's Mom Of The Year** is to giving back to do commanders who have spent their time PGR, which is why the rewards included a lot of games and gaming related items. However, according to the information we have gathered, the authenticity of the winner's game account is questionable. According to the rules, the virtual rewards does not support **1 account, multi user**, and Kuro bans all third-party account trading, which is why we will only be sending out the physical rewards to the current winner on Weibo and Kuro keeps all the **commemorative** rewards as welll as the **Mom Of The Year** title.
4. In future events similiar to this, we will develop an in-game verification section and feature, increasing the efficiency of drawing.

We thank every single commander who has given their support to **Punishing Gray Raven** through all these times.
