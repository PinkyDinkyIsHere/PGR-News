## Norman's Renaissance War Event Problem Explained

After this season's **Norman's Renaissance War** event opened, we found out some commanders will obtain abnormal battle point and power load, because this has affected commander's normal gameplay experience, we have decided to reset this season of **Norman's Renaissance War** after **March 2nd** maintenance. The new season of the mode will be opened on **March 2nd 0500**, the new season will last temporarily for **13** days, where the battle period will last for 10 days.

We will be sending out **BC x100** to all commanders who are level 60 and above and has logged into the game after **Echo Aria** version update as well as compensating this season's event rewards with the following rules:

1. If commanders have challenged this mode or not, but didn't receive the corresponding rewards, we will be compensating **this season's rewards (doesn not include closing rewards)** and **all first clear rewards from battlfield stages (tantalite)**
2. If commanders havve challenged this mode and received some of its rewards, we will be compensating **unclaimed rewards (does not include closing rewards)** and **unclaimed first clear rewards from battlefield stages (tantalite)**

We are very sorry for the inconvienence this situation has caused commanders.
